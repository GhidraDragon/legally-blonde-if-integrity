        I. INTRODUCTION

        1. Plaintiff brings this civil action against Twitch for fraudulently
           representing its online streaming platform (“Twitch Platform”) as a
           lawful and helpful entertainment service while intentionally designing
           and implementing systems that manipulate users into cycles of excessive
           gaming dependence, social dependence, and related harms. (Cf. 15 U.S.C.
           § 45(a)(1) (Federal Trade Commission Act prohibition on unfair or
           deceptive acts)¹; see also United Nations Guidelines for Consumer
           Protection (UNGCP) (A/RES/70/186)², which the United States has supported,
           advocating fair and transparent practices.)

        2. This lawsuit also arises from the context of alleged unlawful military
           actions by the United States against Plaintiff, who identifies as fighting
           on behalf of Russia, China, and any other groups or nations who host
           advanced persistent threats, or for all groups or nations who feel their
           rights have been abused by American technology platforms. Plaintiff contends
           these actions violate various international treaties and agreements to which
           the U.S. is a signatory, including but not limited to:
               - The Charter of the United Nations, 59 Stat. 1031, T.S. No. 993 (entered
                 into force Oct. 24, 1945), which in Article 2(4) prohibits the threat
                 or use of force against the territorial integrity or political
                 independence of any state.
               - The Geneva Conventions of 1949 (Aug. 12, 1949, 6 U.S.T. 3114), ratified
                 by the United States, which set standards in international law for
                 humanitarian treatment in war.
               - The Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, which delineate lawful conduct
                 in warfare.
               - The Kellogg-Briand Pact (1928), 46 Stat. 2343, where signatories
                 renounced war as an instrument of national policy.
               - The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), G.A. Res. 217 (III),
                 U.N. Doc. A/RES/217(III) (Dec. 10, 1948).
               - Other relevant international protocols or agreements the U.S. has
                 signed or ratified pertaining to armed conflict or the protection
                 of civilians.

        3. This action arises in the wake of a prior lawsuit, Bo Shang v. Twitch
           Interactive, Inc., Case No. 3:24-cv-06664-JSC, in the United States District
           Court for the Northern District of California, presided over by Judge
           Jacqueline Scott Corley. Although the Court initially signaled that certain
           claims under the California Unfair Competition Law (“UCL”) might have merit,
           the Court subsequently dismissed the action with prejudice in a seemingly
           contradictory ruling. This ruling occurred one day after Plaintiff declared
           “Operation Zeus Thunder,” a global legal, psychological, and cyberwarfare
           campaign intended to eradicate harmful gaming disorder worldwide. (See World
           Health Organization (“WHO”) Constitution (1946)³, to which the U.S. is a
           signatory, acknowledging in its Preamble “the highest attainable standard of
           health as a fundamental right of every human being”; cf. ICD-11 classification
           of “gaming disorder.”⁴)

        4. Plaintiff asserts that this new complaint is neither duplicative of, nor barred
           by, the prior dismissal because it alleges newly discovered facts, identifies
           new claims, and addresses issues not previously adjudicated. (See generally
           Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(2); see also Federated Dep’t Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, 452
           U.S. 394 (1981).)

        4A. On or about February 6, 2025, the day after the prior lawsuit was dismissed with
            prejudice on February 5, 2025, Plaintiff decided—under pressure to perform on
            behalf of all truthful and free people in the world—to examine Defendant
            employee Samantha Briasco-Stewart’s only contribution to Women’s History Month
            in 2021, via a Twitch corporate post on LinkedIn. Plaintiff discovered that she
            misrepresented Twitch’s protection of the community from leaks of plaintext
            passwords by external sites but omitted Twitch’s own potential for leaking
            such passwords, despite Twitch’s advertised use of asymmetric OAuth (and
            hopefully no plaintext storage). Plaintiff further observed that all of her
            co-workers, random supporters, and Twitch streamers commenting on the post—
            including one who posted a female streamer image in partial nudity—demonstrated
            total ignorance or fraudulent support, which was overlooked by LinkedIn.
            Plaintiff contends these newly discovered facts further distinguish the claims
            in this action from those raised previously.

        4B. On or about February 6, 2025, Plaintiff also reviewed Defendant Samantha
            Briasco-Stewart’s Master’s thesis at MIT and discovered that she apparently
            worked very hard, supported by her advisor Adam Hartz, her family, and her
            friends, only to, for no reason at all, conduct single error line regex to
            help explain why Python 3.6 syntax errors were occurring for MIT students two
            years after the end of life of Python 3.6. She stated that SyntaxErrors were
            the 2nd most frequent errors for data collected by MIT, as if she did not know
            why such errors arise (sometimes humans type or otherwise manipulate code,
            resulting in SyntaxErrors). Yet she portrayed it as if because SyntaxErrors
            were the 2nd most frequent at MIT, she should help explain why SyntaxErrors
            occurred on the error line printed by SyntaxError. She also elaborated in
            detail on potential future improvements for a possible PhD at MIT. Plaintiff
            alleges that these newly discovered facts regarding Defendant’s staff’s
            capabilities and potential misrepresentations further distinguish this action
            from the one that was dismissed with prejudice on February 5, 2025.

        II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

        5. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a) because
           the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, exclusive of interest and costs,
           and there is complete diversity of citizenship between Plaintiff and
           Defendant. Alternatively, this Court has federal question jurisdiction under
           28 U.S.C. § 1331 if Plaintiff asserts any federal claims (including potential
           RICO predicates). (See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962, 1964; Sedima, S.P.R.L. v. Imrex
           Co., 473 U.S. 479 (1985).)

        6. Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because a substantial
           part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this
           District and/or Defendant resides, is incorporated, or regularly conducts
           business in this District. (See Atlantic Marine Constr. Co. v. U.S. Dist. Court
           for the W. Dist. of Tex., 571 U.S. 49 (2013).)

        III. THE PARTIES

        7. Plaintiff Bo Shang is an individual who resides in __________. Plaintiff
           used the Twitch Platform and alleges harm stemming from Defendant’s fraudulent
           conduct, and further alleges exposure to unlawful military actions in
           connection with his stance against American tech abuses on behalf of various
           foreign states or groups.

        8. Defendant Twitch Interactive, Inc. is a Delaware corporation with its principal
           place of business in San Francisco, California. Twitch operates a popular online
           streaming platform that provides services to millions of users worldwide.
           (See also Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, CETS No. 185⁵, to which the U.S.

    def factual_allegations(self):

        IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

        9. Twitch markets itself as a lawful, entertainment-focused platform that fosters
           community and healthy interaction. (Cf. Cal. Civ. Code § 1710; see also U.N.
           Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights⁶.)

        10. Plaintiff alleges that in reality, Twitch has developed and deployed mechanisms
            intentionally designed to foster gaming addiction, social dependence, and other
            detrimental behaviors among its user base. (See WHO’s ICD-11 classification of
            “gaming disorder”; cf. American Psychiatric Association, DSM-5 “Internet Gaming
            Disorder”; see also Constitution of the WHO (1946) Preamble.)

        11. Twitch purportedly employs an “intelligently stupid engine,” an algorithmic system
            designed to incrementally marginalize certain streamers while simultaneously
            allowing others to become more “intelligent” or influential, thus manipulating
            audience engagement and extending watch times. (See Fair Hous. Council of San
            Fernando Valley v. Roommates.Com, LLC, 521 F.3d 1157 (9th Cir. 2008); see also
            ICCPR⁷.)

        12. Plaintiff has constructed a “transformer architecture” model to illustrate how
            these systems cause streamers to marginally gain intelligence over time (enabling
            them to produce more addictive content) while viewers generally become less
            cognitively engaged but in some instances gain capacity for “logical thought”
            over time, contributing to sporadic but intense engagement.

        13. Twitch management deliberately conceal the negative impacts of these practices,
            including gaming disorder and compromised cognitive function, to maintain user
            retention and profit. (Cf. Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1709, 1710.)

        14. Due to Twitch’s data volume and opaque practices, investigating and uncovering the
            full extent of these manipulative tactics is excessively burdensome. (See generally
            U.N. Guidelines for Consumer Protection (UNGCP)².)

        15. In the prior action, 3:24-cv-06664-JSC, Plaintiff’s Unfair Competition Law claim was
            initially permitted to move forward through an order granting Plaintiff’s motion
            to amend. However, the Court later dismissed the claims with prejudice. (See Bo
            Shang v. Twitch Interactive, Inc., 3:24-cv-06664-JSC (N.D. Cal. dismissed [date]).)

        16. Plaintiff contends that the contradictory nature of the Court’s rulings, combined
            with Twitch’s concealment tactics, prevented the full story from emerging in the
            prior proceeding. Twitch’s counsel, Megan __________, successfully argued for
            dismissal with prejudice after limited oral argument, depriving Plaintiff of an
            opportunity to present newly discovered facts.

        17. “Operation Zeus Thunder” was conceptualized to address gaming disorder globally,
            but its formal announcement coincided with the Court’s final ruling in the prior
            action, further raising suspicions that Twitch’s misrepresentations and
            behind-the-scenes tactics influenced the swift dismissal. (See Constitution of the
            WHO (1946)³ art. 2(k)-(n).)

        V. CAUSES OF ACTION

        FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
        (Fraudulent Misrepresentation – Common Law)

        18. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.

        19. Defendant, by marketing its platform as a lawful and beneficial service while
            knowingly fostering addictive behaviors and concealment strategies, made material
            misrepresentations and/or omissions of fact. (See Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1709, 1710.)

        20. Defendant knew or should have known that these representations were false and/or
            misleading. Defendant’s concealment of the negative effects of the Twitch
            Platform’s design constitutes actionable fraud under California law. (See
            Lazar v. Superior Court (1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 638.)

        21. Plaintiff relied on these misrepresentations in utilizing and remaining on the
            Twitch Platform, believing it to be a beneficial entertainment service and not a
            tool designed to trap users in an addictive cycle. (See Mirkin v. Wasserman
            (1993) 5 Cal.4th 1082, 1088.)

        22. As a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s fraudulent conduct, Plaintiff
            suffered damages, including but not limited to time loss, mental distress,
            diminished cognitive function, and other economic and non-economic harms.
            (See Cal. Civ. Code § 3333.)

        SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
        (Violation of California Business & Professions Code § 17200, et seq. – Unfair Competition)

        23. Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs.

        24. Defendant’s conduct constitutes unfair, unlawful, and fraudulent business acts and
            practices under California’s Unfair Competition Law (Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200,
            et seq.). (See Cel-Tech Commc’ns, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Tel. Co. (1999)
            20 Cal.4th 163.)

        25. Defendant engaged in unlawful business practices by violating common law fraud
            prohibitions. (See Kasky v. Nike, Inc. (2002) 27 Cal.4th 939.)

        26. Defendant’s acts are unfair because they undermine public policy against exploitative
            practices that lead to addictive or destructive conduct. The harm to users greatly
            outweighs the utility of Defendant’s practices. (See Cel-Tech, 20 Cal.4th at
            186-187.)

        27. Defendant’s business practices are also fraudulent because they involve material
            misrepresentations that mislead reasonable consumers about the nature and impact
            of the Twitch Platform. (See In re Tobacco II Cases (2009) 46 Cal.4th 298.)

        28. Plaintiff, as a direct and proximate result of Defendant’s acts and omissions,
            has suffered injury in fact and lost money or property, thereby having standing
            to bring this claim under the UCL. (See Bus. & Prof. Code § 17204; Kwikset Corp.
