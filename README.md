So for public repos, we let ChatGPT "red team" and Github could remove if Github deems some ToS; for manually verified exploits (yes ChatGPT can make mistakes; verify truth before assuming so, dumbass; this is the essence of being alive) then move to private repo..

but nobody has time bullshitting or getting a rough what types exist?
